                <p>So I started to walk this path not knowing what was 
                      coming my way. And it is not that easy, I must say. 
                </p>    
                <p> Everthing is going fast and when I see the code of 
                      some of my fellow coders. I don't understand shit.
                </p>
                <p>But... my motivation is still strong and I will work
                      very hard to accomplish my goals. 
                      Strong in this one ... the force is! </p>
                <p>May the force be with you</p>
